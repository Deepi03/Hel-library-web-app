    "info": "Originally a rural physician, Elias Lönnrot (1802–1884) took advantage of time spent in Kainuu, northeastern Finland, by collecting Finnish poems sung in popular oral tradition. Impassioned by his discovery, he published the fruits of his labour under the title Kalevala. The vast mythological epic helped awaken and cement the Finnish national consciousness of the 19th century. The Kalevala themes, complemented by trips to Karelia, have influenced many Finnish artists, including the composer Jean Sibelius.",
